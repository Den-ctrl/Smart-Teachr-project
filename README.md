## Database Setup

To get started with the Smart-Teachr-project, follow these steps to import the necessary SQL file into your MySQL database.

1. **Download the SQL file for our project database**: [project.sql](https://github.com/Den-ctrl/Smart-Teachr-project/blob/main/project.sql).

2. **Import SQL File**:

   - Open a terminal and log in to MySQL:

     ```bash
     mysql -u username -p
     ```

     Replace `username` with your MySQL username.

   - Create a new database (if not already created):

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE project;
     ```

   - Use the newly created database:

     ```sql
     USE project;
     ```

   - Import the SQL file:

     ```bash
     mysql -u username -p project < path/to/project.sql
     ```

## Running the Application

To run the Smart-Teachr-project, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   Open a command prompt (CMD) or terminal and use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the project. For example:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/smart-teachr-project

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   If you're using a virtual environment (venv), activate it by running the appropriate activation command. For example, on Windows:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/smart-teachr-project
   ```
   
   On macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Run the main.py Script**:

   Once the virtual environment is activated, you can run the main.py script. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
